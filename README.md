🏨 Hotel Booking & Billing System
Leveraging Object-Oriented Programming in C++
📌 Project Overview

The Hotel Booking & Billing System is a console-based C++ application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It is designed to manage the basic operations of a small to medium-sized hotel, including room booking and bill calculation.

This project demonstrates how OOP principles can be applied to build a modular, maintainable, and efficient system.

🎯 Objectives

Automate room booking operations

Ensure accurate and instant bill calculation

Reduce manual errors in hotel management

Demonstrate real-world application of OOP concepts

🧩 Key Features

Room availability management

Guest booking system

Automatic bill calculation based on stay duration

Simple and user-friendly console interface

🏗️ System Design

The system is designed using multiple classes, each representing a real-world entity.

🔹 Classes Used
Room

Stores room ID, type, rate, and availability

Controls booking through encapsulated methods

Booking

Links customer details with a room

Calculates total bill based on number of days stayed

🧠 OOP Concepts Applied
1️⃣ Encapsulation

Data members are kept private and accessed through public methods to protect data integrity.

2️⃣ Abstraction

Only essential details are exposed to the user while internal logic remains hidden.

3️⃣ Constructor Usage

Constructors initialize objects with required values at the time of creation.

4️⃣ Object Interaction

Objects of different classes interact to complete the booking and billing process.

💻 Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / Any standard C++ compiler

Platform: Console-based application

▶️ How to Run the Program

Copy the source code into a file named hotel.cpp

Compile the program:

g++ hotel.cpp -o hotel


Run the executable:

./hotel

🖥️ Sample Output
Total Bill: Rs.4000

📚 Learning Outcomes

Practical understanding of Object-Oriented Programming

Experience in designing real-world systems using classes

Improved problem-solving and coding skills in C++
